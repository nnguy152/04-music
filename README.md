Make a keyboard that can play sounds
Can use Web Audio API to make a keyboard with set of tones or use sound files.
Have users be able to choose (radio buttons or scroll) between tone types (sawtooth, triangle, etc)
Or have users select from sounds files I uploaded (undertale, histheme, portal?)

Create something cool looking on the page??? 
Use paper.js or something that is animated on the screen as users
play with the keyboard (have it react to keypresses)
